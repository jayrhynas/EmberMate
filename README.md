# Installation

- Download the latest `ember-macos.dmg` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/matthewnitschke/ember-macos/releases) page
- Extract the zip file and drag the .app (will be called EmberMate) to your Applications folder
- IMPORTANT! Ctrl+Click the application and click "Open", doing so will prompt a dialog, click "Open" again

## Why does apple think ember-macos is malicious software?

![popup](https://github.com/matthewnitschke/ember-macos/assets/6363089/99c1c338-cb6a-4311-b4e4-2b5055b49bce)

This message is displayed because the `EmberMate` application is not what you would call "signed". Apple charges developers yearly to sign applications, and this is something I do not want to pay for at this time

You can force allow opening the application by `ctrl+clicking` the application icon, and selecting "Open" from the dropdown menu
