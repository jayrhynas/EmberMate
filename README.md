- IMPORTANT! Ctrl+Click the application and click "Open", doing so will prompt a dialog, click "Open" again

## Why does apple think ember-macos is malicious software?

This message is displayed because the `ember-macos` application is not what you would call "signed". Apple charges $100 a year to sign appliceations, and this is something I do not want to pay for.

You can force allow opening the application by `ctrl+clicking` the application icon, and selecting "Open" from the dropdown menu
